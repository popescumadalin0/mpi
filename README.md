•	Use this format to cite any wiki page, including pages for Wikipedia entries.
•	If you are a student, ask your professor whether Wikipedia is an appropriate source for you to use in your paper. Wikipedia reports information from other sources, making it a secondary source. Many professors prefer that students cite primary sources.
•	When citing Wikipedia, cite an archived version of a Wikipedia page so that readers can retrieve the version you used.
•	Access the archived version on Wikipedia by selecting “View history” and then the time and date of the version you used.
•	If a wiki does not provide permanent links to archived versions of the page, include the URL for the entry and a retrieval date.
